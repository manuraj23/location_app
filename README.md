# Location-Based Flutter App

## Overview
This Flutter application allows users to input a location (city name or address) and displays it on a map. The app demonstrates key skills in managing user input, integrating maps, and implementing state management.

## Features
- **Location Input:** A simple screen where users can input a location using a text field.
- **Map Integration:** Displays the entered location on a map with a marker.
- **Basic Validation:** Ensures that the location input is not left empty.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid or non-existent locations.

## Screens
1. **Location Input Screen:**
   - A text field where users can input a location (city name, address, or coordinates).
   - Basic validation to ensure the field is not left empty.
   - A button that takes the user to the map screen after the location is entered.

2. **Map Display Screen:**
   - Displays a map showing the entered location.
   - The location is marked on the map using a marker.
   - The map is integrated using a Flutter package like `google_maps_flutter`.
